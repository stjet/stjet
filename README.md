Hi! I'm a hobbyist programmer interested in cryptography, cryptocurrency, image manipulation, a better web, and cool stuff in general.

Most projects and other information at [prussia.dev](https://prussia.dev) (now also on Tor!).

My favourite programming language at the moment is Typescript. Lately though, I've been getting into Scheme, which is incredibly fun to write though not I can't say I'm terribly productive in it... yet. I also know Python, Rust, as well as a small, rapidly dwindling amount of Ruby and Solidity. Oh, and obviously all that HTML, CSS, and JS stuff, if that counts.

Nearly all other (non-personal) code I write is contributions to Banano ecosystem stuff, or work for projects on EVM chains (and at one point Algorand). In the future, I want to find a nice non-crypto project to contribute to, and unrelated, figure out this Android app making thing. But we'll see.

As for favourite projects, [mingde](https://github.com/jetstream0/mingde) (desktop environment thing in HTML canvas, [live link](https://mingde.prussia.dev)) and [hedgeblog](https://github.com/jetstream0/hedgeblog) (static blog with zero frontend JS, [live link](https://prussiafan.club)) are what I enjoyed writing the most, though [pla-den-tor](https://github.com/stjet/pla-den-tor) is what I enjoy using the most.

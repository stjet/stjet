Hi! I'm a hobbyist programmer interested in cryptography, cryptocurrency, image manipulation, and cool stuff in general.

Most projects and other information at [prussia.dev](https://prussia.dev) and [prussia.dev/retro](https://prussia.dev/retro) (now also on Tor!).

My favourite programming language at the moment is Typescript. Lately though, I've been getting into Scheme, which is incredibly fun to write though not I can't say I'm terribly productive in it... yet. I also know Python, Rust, HTML+CSS+JS, as well as a small, rapidly dwindling amount of Ruby and Solidity.

My current favourite projects are [mingde](https://github.com/jetstream0/mingde) (desktop environment thing in html canvas, [live link](https://mingde.prussia.dev)) and [hedgeblog](https://github.com/jetstream0/hedgeblog) (static blog with zero frontend JS, [live link](https://prussiafan.club)).

Want to [hire me](https://prussia.dev/sample)? I mainly do cryptocurrency-related work.

Hi! I'm a hobbyist programmer interested in cryptography, cryptocurrency, image manipulation, a better web, and cool stuff in general.

Most projects and other information at [prussia.dev](https://prussia.dev) (now also on Tor!).

My favourite programming language at the moment is Rust. Lately though, I've been getting into Scheme, which is incredibly fun to write though not I can't say I'm terribly productive in it... yet. I also know Python, Typescript, as well as a small, rapidly dwindling amount of Solidity. Oh, and obviously all that HTML, CSS, and JS stuff, if that counts.

Nearly all other (non-personal) code I write is contributions to Banano ecosystem stuff, or work for projects on EVM chains (and at one point Algorand). In the future, I want to find a nice non-crypto project to contribute to, and unrelated, figure out this Android app making thing. But we'll see.

As for favourite projects, [ming-wm](https://github.com/stjet/ming-wm)\[0] (a retro, framebuffer window manager for linux) and [hedgeblog](https://github.com/stjet/hedgeblog) (static blog with zero frontend JS, [live link](https://prussiafan.club)) are what I enjoyed writing the most, though [pla-den-tor](https://github.com/stjet/pla-den-tor) is what I enjoy using the most.

\[0]: [mingde](https://github.com/stjet/mingde) is a conceptual predecessor to ming-wm, written in Typescript, and outputting to HTML canvas. I really enjoyed making that too. Ming-wm really refines the ideas from mingde and makes the project actually practical and usable. With [koxinga](https://github.com/stjet/koxinga), a text-and-link supporting web browser for ming-wm, more and more of my personal computer usage has shifted to being on ming-wm. If you like Vim/i3, and retro design, I encourage you to check it out.

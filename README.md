Hi! I'm a hobbyist programmer interested in cryptography, cryptocurrency, image manipulation, and cool stuff in general.

Most projects and other information at https://prussia.dev and https://prussia.dev/retro (now also on TOR!).

My favourite programming language at the moment is Typescript, but Rust is also awesome. Lately, I've been getting into Scheme. I also know Python, HTML+CSS+JS, and a little bit of Ruby and Solidity.

My current favourite projects are [Mingde](https://github.com/jetstream0/mingde) and [Hedgeblog](https://github.com/jetstream0/hedgeblog).

Want to hire me? https://prussia.dev/sample
